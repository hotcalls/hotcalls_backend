    Voice management permissions - Staff only access
    
    **üîê Permission Requirements:**
    - **‚ùå Regular Users**: No access to voice management
    - **‚úÖ Staff Members**: Full CRUD operations on voices
    - **‚úÖ Superusers**: Full CRUD operations on voices
    
    **üéØ Security Rationale:**
    - Voice configurations are critical system resources
    - Only administrative staff should manage voice settings
    - Prevents unauthorized voice configuration changes
